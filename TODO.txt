Bugs:
- Undo/redo doesn't work for feature copy-paste.
- Undo of removal of a ghost correctly sets the settings, but undo of removal of a real building
  creates a ghost with empty settings.
- If you click too fast it will edit the settings of the last building instead :(.
- I should properly prefix names in the global namespace.

Features:
- Allow "output cost" (and other outputs features we add) to get the tech to provide info about from
  the network, instead of requiring it to be set manually by the player.
- Output a pulse signal when a research finishes.
- Allow specifying the level of an infinite research?
- Make the refresh rate configurable.
- Synchronously update on some events, such as research finished.
- Output previous research
- Output all queued research?
- Allow users to select a generic-named tech for finite multi-level tech as well (this already works
  for infinite tech), and allow queueing the fixed lower-level tech via the generic-named tech.
- Add a way to only show infinite tech in the selection box, so it's less cluttered.
  "Hide researched" would be better, but doesn't seem to be supported by the filter menu.

Support more outputs about a given research:
- current level
- max level?
- triggers for trigger-based research, which don't have a unit cost
- If there is some good recipe-signal mod, add recipes unlocked when that mod is present.
