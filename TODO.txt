Bugs:
- Undo/redo doesn't work for feature copy-paste.
- Undo of removal of a ghost correctly sets the settings, but undo of removal of a real building
  creates a ghost with empty settings.

Features:
- Allow "output cost" (and other outputs features we add) to get the tech to provide info about from
  the network, instead of requiring it to be set manually by the player.
- Output a pulse signal when a research finishes.
- Allow specifying the level of an infinite research?
- Make the refresh rate configurable.
- Refresh on some events, such as research finished.
- Output previous research

Support more outputs about a given research:
- time cost
- current level
- max level?
- pre-req and successor tech
- recipes unlocked (or maybe just items and fluids those recipes produce, since there aren't recipe
  signals in the base game)
- split up num units required and cost per unit (instead of the multiple of those we do now)
- triggers for trigger-based research, which don't have a unit cost
- whether the research is not available/available/in progress/complete
