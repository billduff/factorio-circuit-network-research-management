Bugs:
- Undo/redo doesn't work for feature copy-paste.
- Undo of removal of a ghost correctly sets the settings, but undo of removal of a real building
  creates a ghost with empty settings.

Features:
- Allow "output cost" (and other outputs features we add) to get the tech to provide info about from
  the network, instead of requiring it to be set manually by the player.
- Output a pulse signal when a research finishes.
- Allow specifying the level of an infinite research?
- Make the refresh rate configurable.
- Synchronously update on some events, such as research finished.
- Output previous research
- Allow users to select a generic-named tech for finite multi-level tech as well (this already works
  for infinite tech), and allow queueing the fixed lower-level tech via the generic-named tech.

Support more outputs about a given research:
- current level
- max level?
- triggers for trigger-based research, which don't have a unit cost
- If there is some good recipe-signal mod, add recipes unlocked when that mod is present.
